I am an ELLIS PhD Student at UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt, working on Quantum Natural Language Processing. Previously I graduated from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, with a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. I also participated in a Double Degree Erasmus program, specializing in Data Science at EURECOM, France.

I have a keen interest in the exciting innovations emerging from the fields of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, and I'm trying to conciliate these mature technologies with the rising field of Quantum Computing. In my free time, I dabble in photography, capturing moments and places around me. Feel free to check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/484_user_not_found/)!. If instead you're curious about quantum computing, take a look at my blog, [The Quantumist](https://the-quantumist.github.io/)!
