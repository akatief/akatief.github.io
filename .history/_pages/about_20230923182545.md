I am an ELLIS PhD Student at UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt, working on Quantum Natural Language Processing. Previously I graduated from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, with a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. I also participated in a Double Degree Erasmus program, specializing in Data Science at EURECOM, France.

I have a keen interest in the exciting innovations emerging from the fields of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. As a side passion, I also dabble in Quantum Computing. In my free time, I enjoy photography, capturing moments and places around me. If you're curious about quantum computing, feel free to explore my blog, The Quantumist!
